# rock-in-charts

A statistic study of the popularity of rock songs in a span of many years. Based on the data from Kaggle graph of the popularity of a paticular song depending on its features for different years. 
This isn't perfect because I looked only for songs from *Billbord hot 100*, but I think there are enough data to gain general understandig of the main popularity trends of one or the other kind of rock songs per year.
